Hi! My name is Satya
  {
  I'm an aspiring programmer based in the United States;
  I'm interested in various topics, such as game dev, software/app dev, and many more;
  Currently, I
    {
      am enrolled in CS50x;
      work around in Unity;
      work on other projects from time-to-time;
    }
    
  The best way to direcly reach me would probably be through my Instagram - @sk.cuber;
